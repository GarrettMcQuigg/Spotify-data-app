Capstone Proposal

1. The tech stack I will be using for this project is React for the front-end, and NodeJS 
and ExpressJS for the back-end. I am still deciding whether I want to use Tailwind CSS as 
a CSS framework or use Vanilla CSS.

2. The focus of my project is going to be mainly on the front-end. There will definitely
 be some work put into the server side, but the majority of time I will allocate to this project will be client-side related.

3. This capstone project will be a “website” extension, based off of the Spotify app.

4. The goal of this project is to build an application that allows users (of Spotify) to see 
a more detailed view of their app usage.

5. The demographic for this project is all Spotify users.

6. I will be using the Spotify API to access data that is not normally accessible to the public, 
but is stored by Spotify nonetheless.

7. An issue I may run into with this API is being restricted to the data that the API provides. 
I may want to add additional information that the API doesn’t include, so we will see if that 
is possible or not. The only sensitive information I will need to keep secure is the user's password. 
The application will have user auth, as well as the ability to access a user’s favorite tracks and 
artists of all time, and other fun metrics/pieces of data that Spotify stores.
